# Chatbot
This is a simple chatbot. The trainingdata is minimal and written by myself. You can chat with the bot, you can play games, read your mails, check the time and the weather and open programs like Word (if installed on the given path).

You can initialize the chatbot with the name of the json file with the trainingdata as parameter.
You can chat with the chatbot with the function chat on the chatbot.
The function train should not be called unless you changed the trainingdata and want to retrain the bot.
